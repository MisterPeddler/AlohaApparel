Summary

This is the initial project we created in the first week of our Web Development course using HTML and CSS. We started by building out the structure and style of the desktop version of a retail website, and are now currently working on developing a responsive, mobile-first version.

Specifications
Some key requirements included writing modular, semantic code that was properly indented, well-organized, and clearly marked for future uses and/or users. Additionally, it was crucial to replicate the design comps as closely as possible to practice paying attention to detail as well as honoring a designer's original artistic vision.

Challenges
The hurdles I faced were mainly with positioning and sizing in CSS; particularly, the accurate placement of background images, the absolute positioning of the 'Subscribe' button, as well as floating list elements with even spacing. I am still absorbing the idea of flexible grids and images.

Takeaways
I particularly enjoyed learning about mobile-first rules, how to use web fonts and kits, as well as how to use the Command Line to interact with the computer, and also push commits onto GitHub. The use of gradients and opacity in CSS was also fun to learn, and I found the existence of icon fonts to be particularly brilliant.
